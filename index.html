    No pressure. Some things just need some time.

    <h2>
        History
    </h2>

    For several decades wirepullers behind most central banks could create their money out of thin air. <br>
    The incentives for giving this money to people who create the most value for other people - like farmers, nurses, doctors and many more - have not been strong enough to foster a fair system. <br>
    
    In order to foster fair systems we invest into professional incentive engineering. 

    <h2>
        Question
    </h2>

    How can we design incentive systems in a way that people are rewarded for creating value? <br>

    We are very happy that some people care. Thanks to all Open Source Developers.
