          <div class="font-bold text-base">Distributed Ledger Technology</div>
          One important aspect why Bitcoin, Ethereum and other systems are so reliable is
          that they use the Distributed Ledger Technology. A ledger can be seen as a list
          of transactions. If this ledger is stored on several different servers, one can
          call it distributed ledger.
        </div>

        <div class="mt-4 shadow p-4 rounded">
          <div class="font-bold text-base">Blockchain</div>
          <div>
            In Bitcoin transactions are stored in blocks. Those blocks are connected. You
            can perceive it as a chain of Blocks. This is why people call this technology
            Blockchain Technology.

        <div class="mt-4 shadow p-4 rounded">
          <div class="font-bold text-base">Smart Contracts</div>
          <div>
            Programs which can be stored and executed on a blockchain are frequently
            called smart contracts. You can perceive a smart contract as an agreement /
            contract between the parties who interact with this contract. Example: If you
            use a vending machine at a train station you typically implicitly have the
            agreement that if you throw in money, you get a product out of it. Such kinds
            of agreements / contracts which apply themselves automatically can be called
            smart contracts.

          <div class="font-bold text-base">Consensus Algorithms</div>
          In a distributed ledger it is important that there is consensus about the
          content of the ledger. To reach this consensus people apply algorithms like
          Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS). PoW is pretty energy consuming /
          costly. Therefore famous Blockchains like ETH2.0 introduce PoS.

        <div class="mt-4 shadow p-4 rounded">
          <div class="font-bold text-base">ERC20 Tokens</div>
          <div>
            This is a standard which allows you to deploy your own cryptocurrency on the
            Ethereum Blockchain in a very simple way. ERC721 Tokens = Coins can be
            considered as fungible tokens.

          <div class="font-bold text-base">ERC721 Tokens</div>
          <div>
            <div>
              This is a standard which is frequently used to represent collectibles (where
              uniqueness of each entity is the thing). ERC721 Tokens can be considered as
              non-fungible tokens.

          Currencies which are generated via central banks and sold by politicians /
          governments with no or very low intrinsic value are frequently called fiat
          currencies. Some might call fiat currencies a "creatio ex nihilo" (a creation
          out of nothing (but power)).

            Let me know if there is any word from the crypto scene which you would like to
            get a simple explanation for. Some asked me to add detailed info about the
            truffle framework, ganache and drizzle. I do not go into those development
            details on this page because it is mainly meant as a simple and quickly to
            understand starting point.

          You can use crypto wallets to store crypto assets like crypto currency entities,
          and to interact with smart contracts on a blockchain. There are several kinds of
          wallets. E.g. Browserwallets which are integrated directly in the Browser
          (brave.com).

            Initial Coin Offerings can be compared to Initial Public Offerings where
            companies or projects sell parts of their company to investors.

          <div class="font-bold text-base">Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</div>
          <div>
            Decentralized Finance consists of Decentralized Autonomous Payments (DAP),
            Decentral Autonomous Deposits (DAD), Decentral Autonomous Loans (DAL),
            Decentral Autonomous Funds (DAF) and perhaps more to come.

          <div class="font-bold text-base">Oracles</div>
          Oracles solve the challenge that smart contracts themselves only have access to
          data which is on the blockchain. For example they (smart contracts) do not know
          how the weather is until anyone brings this information to their blockchain.
          Oracles can be used to do exactly this. One key challenge here was to make sure
          correct information is brought to the blockchain. A famous promising system for
          this is Chainlink.

          <div class="font-bold text-base">Solidity</div>
          <div>
            Solidity is a famous programming language to define smart contracts. A
            potential alternative is the Vyper Smart Contract Language.
