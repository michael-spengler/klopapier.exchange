        <div class="font-bold">Distributed Ledger Technology</div>
        One important aspect why Bitcoin, Ether and other systems are so reliable is that
        they use the Distributed Ledger Technology. A ledger can be seen as a list of
        transactions. If this ledger is stored on several different servers, one calls it
        distributed ledger.
      </div>

      <div class="shadow p-4 rounded">
        <div class="font-bold">Blockchain</div>
        <div>
          In Bitcoin transactions are stored in blocks. Those blocks are connected. You
          can perceive it as a chain of Blocks. This is why this technology is called
          Blockchain Technology.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="shadow p-4 rounded">
        <div class="font-bold">Smart Contracts</div>
        <div>
          Programs which can be stored and executed on a blockchain are frequently called
          smart contracts. You can perceive those as an agreement / contract between the
          parties who interact with this contract. Example: If you use a vending machine
          at a train station you typically implicitly have the agreement that if you throw
          in money, you get a product out of it. Such kinds of agreements / contracts
          which apply themselves automatically can be called smart contracts.

    <div class="mt-12 grid grid-cols-3 gap-12">
      <div class="shadow p-4 rounded">
        <div class="font-bold">Consensus Algorithms</div>
        In a distributed ledger it is important that there is consensus about the content
        of the ledger. To reach this consensus people apply algorithms like Proof of Work
        (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS). PoW is pretty energy consuming / costly. Therefore
        famous Blockchains like ETH2.0 introduces PoS.
      </div>

      <div class="shadow p-4 rounded">
        <div class="font-bold">ERC20 Tokens</div>
        <div>
          This is a standard which allows you to deploy your own cryptocurrency on the
          Ethereum Blockchain in a very simple way. They can be considered as fungible
          tokens.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="shadow p-4 rounded">
        <div class="font-bold">ERC721 Tokens</div>
        <div>
          This is a standard which is frequently used to represent collectibles (where
          uniqueness is valuable). They can be considered as non-fungible tokens.
        </div>

    <div class="mt-12 grid grid-cols-3 gap-12">
      <div class="shadow p-4 rounded">
        <div class="font-bold">Crypto Wallets</div>
        You can use crypto wallets to store crypto assets like crypto currency entities.
        There are several kinds of wallets. E.g. Browserwallets which are integrated
        directly in the Browser.

      <div class="shadow p-4 rounded">
        <div class="font-bold">ICO</div>
        <div>
          Initial Coin Offerings can be compared to Initial Public Offerings where
          companies or projects sell parts of their company to investors.

      <div class="shadow p-4 rounded">
        <div class="font-bold">Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</div>
        <div>
          Decentralized Finance can be differentiated into Decentralized Autonomous
          Payments (DAP), Decentral Autonomous Deposits (DAD), Decentral Autonomous Loans
          (DAL), Decentral Autonomous Funds (DAF) and perhaps more to come.

      <div class="shadow p-4 rounded">
        <div class="font-bold">Oracles</div>
        Oracles solve the challenge that smart contracts themselves only have access to
        data which is on the blockchain. For example they (smart contracts) do not know
        how the weather is until anyone brings this information to their blockchain.
        Oracles can be used to do exactly this. A famous promising system for this is
        Chainlink.
      </div>

      <div class="shadow p-4 rounded">
        <div class="font-bold">Solidity</div>
        <div>
          Solidity is a famous programming language to define smart contracts. A potential
          alternative is the Vyper Smart Contract Language.
