    <h2>History</h2>

    For several decades people behind most central banks could create their money out
    of thin air. <br />
    The incentives for giving this money to people who create the most value for other
    people - like farmers, nurses, doctors and many more - have not been strong enough to
    foster a fair system.
    <p></p>

    In order to foster fair systems we invested some time into professional incentive
    engineering. We came to the conclusion that Ether, Bitcoin & Co. can play valuable
    roles in this game. <br />

    <p></p>
    This is one of the reasons why we want to share our perspectives in a fun and valuable
    way. <br />

    It seems strange that about 95 % (rough guess) of adult people on earth don't even
    have a
    <a href="https://brave.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brave Ethereum</a> or
    Bitcoin wallet yet.

    <p></p>
    In times where many central banks plan to sell us even a digital wipepaper - aka.
    Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), we think it is really the right time to come up
    with this little exploration project.

    This project is mainly an education playground for some of my students at
    <a href="https://www.mannheim.dhbw.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DHBW Mannheim</a

    <p></p>
    At the same time we are happy about high quality contributions from anyone.
    <p></p>

    We want to provide valuable and fun education around decentralized incentive
    engineering and peer to peer collaboration.
    <p></p>
    Along this way we also promote cool platforms in the DeFi ecosystem like
    <a href="https://gitcoin.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gitcoin.co</a>,
